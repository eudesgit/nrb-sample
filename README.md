# A Node + React + Bootstrap sample app

Just a simple small app that integrates Node.JS, React.JS and Bootstrap.

React and Bootstrap for front-end and Node.JS for back-end service.

## Getting started

Follow the instructions to download and run the app on Node.JS and React development environment.

### Setup

* [Install Node.JS/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Clone/download the repository to your local folder.
* Access nrb-sample/server-node
* Run 'npm install' to install Node side dependencies.
* Access nrb-sample/web-react
* Run 'npm install' to install React and its dependecies.

Or start your own Node and React environment doing the following:

* Install Node.JS/NPM
* Install Express.
* [Set up your React development environment](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-new-app.html)
* Clone/download the repository and you'll figure out. It's all just a simple React app. :)

### Running

First start the server.

* Access nrb-sample/server-node
* Run server.js

Your Node server will run on localhost:3001. Go check it out on your browser.

Then, start your React development environment

* Access nrb-sample/server-node
* Run 'npm start'

Your React dev environment will run on localhost:3000. It'll probably open your browser with the app fully operational.

If it doesn't work out, take a look at the requirements, install everything and you'll figure it out.

## Requirements

* Node.JS
* React.JS
* Bootstrap 4
* Express
* React Router
